Direct Rule Tests
Empty Cells in Light - LTUP-BASC-0001
Test Case 1 - Empty Cell in Light Direct Rule:

EmptyCells
Checks that the rule correctly detects empty cells in light (yellow tiles), and doesn't erroneously detect black cells, lightbulbs, or unlit empty cells as empty cells in light.
Empty Corners - LTUP-BASC-0002
Test Case 1 - Empty Corners Test:

EmptyCorners
Checks that adding empty cell marks to (2,2), (0,2), and (4,3) does correctly satisfy the empty corners rule.
Checks that adding an empty cell mark to (4,5) does not get accepted as satisfying the rule, as it is skipping steps.
Checks that adding an empty cell mark to (4,1) does not falsely trigger the empty corners rule.
